# The Notes class holds all the logic needed for crawling a directory of files, 
# searching for a set of patterns to annotate.

# Samples:
# NOTE: This line should get annoated by Notes.
# OPTIMIZE Make things faster!
# TODO: Annotate your tasks.
# FIXME: Keep up with things to fix.

class Notes
  
  # Defines the patterns that will be checked during file annotating.
  # If you want to run this on something other than ruby, coffeesciprt, or javascript 
  # files then you may need to change this. The default pattern is looking for a line 
  # beginning with a comment and then followed with "TODO", "NOTE", or "OPTIMIZE" keywords.
